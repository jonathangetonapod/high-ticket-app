This guide ensures your sequences are persistent without being annoying.\n\n---\n\n## Timing Between Emails\n\n### Recommended Sequence Timing\n\n| Email | Days After Previous | Purpose |\n|-------|--------------------|---------|\n| Email 1 | Day 0 | Initial outreach |\n| Email 2 | Day 2-3 | First follow-up |\n| Email 3 | Day 5-7 | Value add |\n| Email 4 | Day 10-14 | Different angle |\n| Email 5 | Day 21-28 | Breakup email |\n\n### Why 2-3 Days Works\n- Enough time to read and respond\n- Short enough to stay relevant\n- Creates gentle urgency\n- Accounts for busy schedules\n\n### Timing Adjustments\n- **Executives (C-level):** Add 1-2 days between emails\n- **Mid-level:** Standard timing\n- **Urgency campaigns:** Can tighten to 1-2 days\n- **Long sales cycles:** Extend to 5-7 days between\n\n### Day/Time Best Practices\n- **Best days:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday\n- **Best times:** 8-10 AM or 2-4 PM (recipient's timezone)\n- **Avoid:** Monday morning, Friday afternoon, weekends\n\n---\n\n## How Follow-ups Should Reference Previous Emails\n\n### The Right Way\n\n**Soft reference (Preferred):**\n```\nHey {{firstName}},\n\nBumping this up in case it got buried — thought this could \nbe relevant for {{companyName}}'s outbound goals.\n```\n\n**Thread continuation:**\n```\nHey {{firstName}},\n\nWanted to add one more thought to my previous note...\n```\n\n**New value:**\n```\n{{firstName}},\n\nSince I last reached out, we just helped [Client] achieve \n[result]. Thought this might be relevant for {{companyName}}.\n```\n\n### The Wrong Way\n\n❌ \"Did you get my last email?\"\n❌ \"I haven't heard back from you...\"\n❌ \"Following up for the 4th time...\"\n❌ \"I know I've emailed a few times, but...\"\n❌ \"Just checking if you saw my message\"\n\n### Thread Management\n- Follow-ups should be replies to the original thread\n- Same subject line (RE: auto-added)\n- Keeps context visible\n- Improves deliverability (ongoing conversation)\n\n---\n\n## Keeping It Short\n\n### Follow-up Length Guidelines\n\n| Email | Max Words | Max Sentences |\n|-------|-----------|---------------|\n| Email 1 | 100-125 | 4-5 |\n| Email 2 | 50-75 | 2-3 |\n| Email 3 | 75-100 | 3-4 |\n| Email 4 | 50-75 | 2-3 |\n| Email 5 | 50-60 | 2-3 |\n\n### Why Shorter Is Better\n- Shows respect for their time\n- Easier to read on mobile\n- Forces you to be clear\n- Higher response rates\n\n### Short Follow-up Templates\n\n**Email 2 (Day 2-3):**\n```\n{{firstName}} — bumping this up.\n\nWorth a quick chat this week?\n\n{{senderName}}\n```\n\n**Email 3 (Day 5-7):**\n```\nHey {{firstName}},\n\nThought this case study might be relevant — [link]. \nShows how we helped [similar company] with [result].\n\nInterested in seeing if this could work for {{companyName}}?\n```\n\n---\n\n## When to Break Up / Give Value\n\n### Adding Value in Sequence\n\nNot every follow-up should ask for a meeting. Mix in value:\n\n**Value Email Options:**\n- Share relevant case study\n- Send helpful article (not yours)\n- Offer free resource or template\n- Share industry insight\n- Reference their recent company news\n\n### Value Email Template\n```\nHey {{firstName}},\n\nNot trying to sell you anything with this one — just came \nacross [resource] and thought of {{companyName}}.\n\n[Brief explanation of why it's relevant]\n\n{{senderName}}\n```\n\n### The Break-Up Email (Email 5)\n\nThe breakup email often gets the highest response rate. Why:\n- Creates scarcity\n- Removes pressure\n- Gives them an easy out (which often prompts action)\n\n**Breakup Email Templates:**\n\n**Template 1 - Permission to close:**\n```\n{{firstName}},\n\nI haven't heard back, so I'm guessing the timing isn't right.\n\nShould I close out your file, or is there a better time \nto reconnect?\n\n{{senderName}}\n```\n\n**Template 2 - Simple:**\n```\n{{firstName}},\n\nNot a fit? No worries — just let me know and I'll stop \nreaching out.\n\n{{senderName}}\n```\n\n**Template 3 - Direct:**\n```\nLast one, {{firstName}}.\n\nIf outbound lead gen isn't a priority for {{companyName}} \nright now, totally understand. Just say the word.\n\n{{senderName}}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Final Email Best Practices\n\n### What Makes Breakups Work\n- Keep it under 50 words\n- No guilt trips\n- Give them an easy out\n- Ask a yes/no question\n- Make it easy to respond\n\n### What NOT to Do in Final Emails\n❌ \"I've tried reaching you multiple times...\"\n❌ \"I'm confused why you haven't responded\"\n❌ \"This is my last email\" (then sending more)\n❌ Passive-aggressive tone\n❌ Long explanations of why they should respond\n\n### After the Breakup\n- Wait 30-60 days before re-engaging\n- Re-approach with new angle/trigger event\n- Don't reference the old sequence\n- Treat it as a fresh start\n\n---\n\n## Complete Sequence Example\n\n### Email 1 (Day 0) — Initial Outreach\n```\nSubject: {{firstName}}, quick question about {{companyName}}\n\nHey {{firstName}},\n\nSaw {{companyName}} is scaling the sales team — congrats \non the growth.\n\nWe help B2B SaaS companies book 15-20 qualified demos/month \nthrough targeted cold email. Just helped [similar company] \nhit that number last quarter.\n\nWorth a quick chat to see if this could work for \n{{companyName}}?\n\n{{senderName}}\n```\n\n### Email 2 (Day 3) — Bump\n```\n{{firstName}} — bumping this up.\n\nHappy to share how we got [result] for [client] if helpful.\n\n{{senderName}}\n```\n\n### Email 3 (Day 7) — Value Add\n```\nHey {{firstName}},\n\nThought you might find this useful — here's the exact \nsequence template that's working for our SaaS clients: \n[link to resource]\n\nNo strings attached. Let me know if it's helpful.\n\n{{senderName}}\n```\n\n### Email 4 (Day 14) — Different Angle\n```\n{{firstName}},\n\nCurious — is {{companyName}} currently using cold email \nfor outbound, or focusing on other channels?\n\nEither way, happy to share what's working in your space.\n\n{{senderName}}\n```\n\n### Email 5 (Day 28) — Breakup\n```\nLast one, {{firstName}}.\n\nIf this isn't a priority for {{companyName}} right now, \njust let me know and I'll close out your file.\n\n{{senderName}}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Principle | Guideline |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| Timing | 2-3 days between emails |\n| Sequence length | 5 emails max |\n| Follow-up length | Shorter than previous |\n| Value emails | Include 1-2 per sequence |\n| Breakup | Always include, keep short |\n| After breakup | Wait 30-60 days to re-engage |",

Verify individually.\n\n---\n\n## Deduplication Requirements\n\n### What to Dedupe\n\n**1. Exact email match**\n- Remove all duplicate email addresses\n- Keep most recent/complete record\n\n**2. Same person, different email**\n- john@company.com vs jsmith@company.com\n- Use first_name + last_name + company match\n\n**3. Cross-campaign deduplication**\n- Check against currently active campaigns\n- Check against recent campaigns (last 30-60 days)\n- Check against global opt-out list\n\n### Deduplication Process\n1. Dedupe within the new list\n2. Check against active campaign leads\n3. Check against suppression list\n4.
