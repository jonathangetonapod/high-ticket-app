# Strategy Context Requirements

## Required Context Sources

At least ONE of these must be loaded:

1. **Gmail Thread** — Email correspondence with client
2. **Slack Channel** — Team discussion about the client
3. **Fathom Recording** — Strategy call transcript

## What to Extract

From the strategy context, you should identify:

### ICP Definition
- Target job titles
- Company size range
- Industry/vertical
- Geographic focus
- Any exclusions

### Pain Points
- Main challenges the prospect faces
- Specific triggers that indicate need
- Timing considerations

### Value Proposition
- What the client offers
- Key differentiators
- Case studies/proof points to reference

### Messaging Guidelines
- Tone preferences (formal/casual)
- Topics to avoid
- Specific language the client uses

## Validation Checks

The system will verify:

1. ✅ Context was loaded (Gmail, Slack, or Fathom)
2. ✅ ICP is clearly defined
3. ✅ Email copy aligns with extracted context
4. ✅ Lead list matches ICP criteria

## Notes

- If strategy call was verbal only, document key points in the Loom
- When in doubt, ask the client for clarification
- Update context notes if requirements change mid-campaign
